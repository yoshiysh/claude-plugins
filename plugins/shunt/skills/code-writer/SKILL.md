```bash
# Generate and write directly to target file
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/code-write --spec "<what to generate>" --reference <reference-file> --target <output-path>

# Output to stdout instead (omit --target)
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/code-write --spec "<what to generate>" --reference <reference-file>
```

Each call is independent. To build on what was just generated, pass that file as the
`--reference` for the next call.

Review the output and make surgical edits for the ~5-20% that needs Claude-level judgment.
